The aim of this project is to develop and test novel path planning algorithms that use the capacities of the cloud and edge computing resources for control, satisfying time and safety constraints. The experiment is designed to reveal insight on the tradeoffs between local and remote computing, and will lead to new decision mechanisms that are near-optimal, fast, and energy-efficient.
